This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

1. Plot fuel efficiency on highway against the car's engine size
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(data = mpg) +
geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

2. Add aesthetic property to car's class

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```

3. Set aesthetic properties of the geom manually - color outside aesthetics, don't convey info about variables

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue"
)
```

4.Split your plot into facets, subplots that each display one subset of the data.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
